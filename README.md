# SE School - HW03/04 - Testing/Architecture

This REST API web server app provides basic features:

- registering new users
- logging existing users in
- showing current BTC to UAH rate to authorized users

The db files are commited for example purposes.

The homework's goal is:

- to write unit and integration tests
- to draw application's desired architecture

The homework's motto:

- _Юнит-тест проверяет правильность работы одной единицы поведения. (с) В.Х._

## Note to code reviewer

Hi Bogdan!  
&nbsp;  
Thank you for the homework task. That was a great opportunity to learn more about testing frameworks that were on my list.  
The ReadMe is long, but relevant sections are:

- [Testing](#testing)
- [Architecture](#architecture-task)
- [Structure](#structure)

I will be glad to hear any feedback and suggestions.  
Happy reviewing :)

## Architecture task

The Ports&Adapters Architecture variant was chosen for the task:

![Arch](./docs/web-btc-api-arch.jpg)

## Setting up the app locally

1. Clone the repository:

```
      git clone https://github.com/Larisa-Antsifrova/se-school-hw03-testing.git
```

2. Go to the cloned project folder:

```
      cd se-school-hw03-testing
```

3. Create .env file. Declare env variables for JWT and rates provider:

```
      JWT_SECRET_KEY={custom secret key for JWT sign: any string}

      COINLAYER_API_KEY={api key for coinlayer rates api}
```

4. Install dependencies:

```
      npm i
```

5. Start the app in development mode:

```
      npm run start:dev
```

## Testing

#### Unit and Integration tests

For the sake of this homework, all tests are located in _tests_ folder. The structure inside the folder generally follows the app's structure.  
&nbsp;  
Once the app is set up, the following command runs the tests:

```
      npm test
```

The script will run the tests, print feedback in colsole, and generate index.html coverage report that can be found in automatically created _coverage_ folder.

[VSCode-jest extension](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest) was used to run tests on typing and get immediate feedback.  
If IDE extention is not an option, then the following flags can be added to **test script** in package.json:

```
      --watch #runs tests related to changed files
      --watchAll #runs all tests
```

What claims to be Integration tests is located in _tests > app_ folder. There, only external BTC rate service is mocked as a mutable out-of-process unmanaged collaborator.

#### Postman API tests

Out of curiousity, some API testing in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) was explored. The exported Postman collection is placed in _tests-postman_ folder.  
These tests can be run with the command:

```
      npm run test:postman
```

The script will run API tests, print feedback in console, and create _newman_ folder with fancy report in html format. Each test run generates new report.

Disclamer:

- These tests cover very basic scenarios for the example's sake.
- They test app as it is and trigger prod/dev database as well as send additional http requests.
- These tests are super fragile. Sometimes, they seem to consider even background music as well (observation: they definitely did not like Nirvana, but work more or less fine with 21 Guns by Greed Day).

## Endpoints

### / - Home

Returns welcome message with basic information about other endpoints.

#### Home endpoint request

```shell

GET /

```

#### Home endpoint response

```shell

Status: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: {
  "message": "Welcome! Please visit /user/create endpoint to register or /user/login to login.
  Once logged in you can visit /btcRate to learn what current bitcoin rate is."
  }

```

### /user/create - Registration of a new user

Registers new users.

- Name, email and password are required.
- The fields are validated with Joi library.
- If the email is already in use, the error of conflict is returned.
- If validation is successful and email is unique, the password is hashed and the new user is saved in database.
- No authentication token is returned in case verification stage will be added (for example, verification via e-mail).

#### Registration request

```shell

POST /user/create
Content-Type: application/json
RequestBody: {
  "name": "Software Engineering School",
  "email": "software@engineering.school",
  "password": "ses123456"
}

```

#### Registration validation error

```shell

Status: 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: <Joi validation message>

```

#### Registration conflict error

```shell

Status: 409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: {
  "message": "This email is already in use."
}

```

#### Registration success response

```shell

Status: 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: {
  message: "You have successfully registered."
}

```

### /user/login - Logging in a user

Authenticates a user.

- Email and password are required.
- The fields are validated only for their presence.
- If a user with the provided e-mail and/or password does not exist in database, general error message is returned.
- If validation is successful and credentials are right, the JSON Web Token is created and returned.
- JWT has limited life span.

#### Login request

```shell

POST /user/login
Content-Type: application/json
RequestBody: {
  "email": "software@engineering.school",
  "password": "ses123456"
}

```

#### Login validation error

```shell

Status: 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: {
  "message": "<field> is required"
}

```

#### Login authentication error

```shell

Status: 401 Unauthorized
ResponseBody: {
  "message": "Invalid credentials."
}

```

#### Login success response

```shell

Status: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: {
  "message": "You have successfully logged in.",
  "user": {
      "name": "Software Engineering School",
      "email": "software@engineering.school",
      "token": <header.payload.signature>
    }
}

```

### /btcRate - Current BTC to UAH rate information

Provides current rate of BTC to UAH.

- The endpoint is available only for authenticated users.
- isAuthenticated middleware verifies JWT in Authorization header (Bearer token).
- If the provided JWT is valid the endpoint returns current rate of 1 BTC to UAH.
- [Coinlayer API](https://coinlayer.com/documentation) is used to get the rate.

#### Current BTC to UAH rate request

```shell

GET /btcRate

```

#### Rate response

```shell

Status: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
ResponseBody: {
  "timestamp": 1624571946,
  "target": "UAH",
  "rates": {
      "BTC": 958151.489893
    }
  }

```
